# Google Analytics examples

These are some examples of how to intergrate Google Analytics into a site. 

These examples include forms (with and without ajax submittion), impressions and read more button clicks.

These demos require php to function. Download and add this folder into a apache directory to view the files.

The CSS and JS used in these examples are bleeding edge, and therefore will require fallbacks and polyfills when using in live sites. Use the babel build tools set up in the rbd_clean folder to make this easier.
